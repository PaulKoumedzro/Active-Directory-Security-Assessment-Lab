# Network-Penetration-Testing-Lab

# Objective
The objective of this network penetration testing lab is to simulate real-world cyber threats by evaluating the security posture of a networked environment. The lab aims to identify vulnerabilities in systems, applications, and configurations, assess their potential exploitability, and mitigating security flaws within network infrastructures. The purpose of the testing is to identify and document weaknesses in network devices, firewalls, servers and applications that could be exploited by malicious actors; improve defensive strategies by recommending mitigation techniques and security ehancements.


# Skills Learned
- Network scanning using Nmap.
- Identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities in network devices, applications and services.
- Vulnerability assessment
- Applying security best practices to harden network against common attack vectors


# Tool Used
- Nmap an ONSIT tool used for reconnaissance and enumeration
- https://www.exploit-db.com/ a vulnerability database
- Metasploitable
- Windows 10
- Active Directory 2022
